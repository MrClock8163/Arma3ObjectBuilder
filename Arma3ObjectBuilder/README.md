# Arma 3 Object Builder

Arma 3 Object Builder is a free, community add-on for Blender to help content development for Arma 3. The add-on is based on the ideas of the [ArmAToolbox](https://github.com/AlwarrenSidh/ArmAToolbox) add-on developed by Alwarren, but exists as a completely different implementation of a similar workflow, with a great number improved and extended features.

## Main features

- P3D import-export
- ASC import-export
- RTM import-export
- armature reconstruction
- various editing tools
- utility functions

## Documentation

The documentation can be found on [GitBook](https://mrcmodding.gitbook.io/arma-3-object-builder/home). As the add-on changes, the documentation will be updated.

## Installation

The add-on can be installed after either downloading a packaged release, or cloning the repository and manually packing it.
For information about add-on installation, visit the official [Blender documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html) page about add-ons.

For Blender 4.2 and higher, the add-on can also be installed from the official [Extensions repository](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/arma3objectbuilder).
