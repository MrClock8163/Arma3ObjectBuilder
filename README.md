# Arma 3 Toolbox

This fork of Alwarren's ArmAToolbox aims to clean up the old codebase, reorganize it, as well as add new features eventually.

Planned changes:
- Removing unused functions of older versions
- Reorganize the tools in the UI
- Clear up confusing names, and add tooltip documentation to operators
- Possibly integrate the [Arma 3 model.cfg node editor](https://github.com/MrClock8163/BlenderModelCfgEditor), and [Arma 3 Object Builder utility functions](https://github.com/MrClock8163/ToolsArchive/blob/main/Blender%20Python%20API/mrc_a3_objectbuilder.py) addons into the toolbox
- Fix currently broken functions (eg.: due to API change)
